# Project 2: Michael Leach's Writing and Speaking emphasis tables

This app displays a class table that shows a list of courses that need to be taken
depending on how many credits a user has.
To run the app open the src folder of this app in the Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal
Now type in "npm install"
After that is done type in "npm start" to run the app.

In the Student Name bar you can type in your name and that name will display above both 
tables. The credits bar shows what classes you need to take depending on how many credits
you have.
