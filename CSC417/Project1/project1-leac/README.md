# Project 1: Michael Leach's searchable class table

This app displays a class table that shows course info
To run the app open the src folder of this app in the Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal
Now type in "npm install"
After that is done type in "npm start" to run the app.

In the search bar you can filter classes by grade. The search filter is case sensitive so make sure to type in the letter grade as it is inputted in the class table. Ex: "A" returns all classes with grade A.
If you type "all" in the search bar the app should return all classes on the class list.
